      <p>Introduction Optical interconnections between Si LSI chips have been attracting increasing
        interest as a key technology to overcome communication bottlenecks in future LSI systems
        and/or to realize new functional LSI systems &#x0005B;1-3&#x0005D;. Figure I schematically
        illustrates the structure of the optically interconnected LSIs. InP lasers, preferably
        surface emitting lasers, are integrated on LSI chips and the optical signals are emitted
        through the transparent Si substrate to another LSI chip. InP lasers are suitable for this
        purpose because Si is transparent at the emission wavelength. Optionally, diffractive
        optical elements (DOEs) such as diffractive lens and beam diffractors can be integrated on
        backside of the Si wafer. In two-dimensional integration, the LSIs with lasers are mounted
        on a waveguide substrate such as glass or Si and are optically interconnected using DOEs
        fabricated on the Si back surface and the waveguide Z:4 substrates. . In order to implement
        the interconnections, a technique has to be developed to integrate high-quality InP lasers
        on Si. Several approaches have been investigated for this purpose, including solder bonding
        141, lattice-mismatched epitaxial growth &#x0005B;5-6&#x0005D;, and wafer
        bonding&#x0005B;7-9&#x0005D;. Solder bonding with metals such as AuSn is the most
        straightforward method &#x0005B;41, but it is not suitable for vertical interconnections as
        shown in Fig. I (a) because the metals interrupt the surface-normal light propagation.
        Lattice- mismatched epitaxial growth has been widely investigated and room-temperature CW
        operation of the InP lasers has been successfully demonstrated &#x0005B;5-6&#x0005D;.
        However, there are some problems in this growth technique, such as high dislocation density
        (&gt; 5x106 cm ) and high growth temperature (typically &gt; 900 'C for thermal pre-cleaning
        of Siand&gt;550'Cforepitaxialgrowth).Thelatterseemstobe Fig. 1: Optically interconnected
        LSIs. more problematic for the device integration because the fully processed LSIs,
        especially aluminum interconnection metals, will be degraded when they are exposed to the
        temperature higher than 500 'C &#x0005B;10-11&#x0005D;. Wafer bonding is another promising
        candidate. It is a technique to bond different wafers by contacting the flat surfaces
        face-to-face after appropriate surface cleaning without using any adhesives. It is possible
        to bond wafers at low temperatures (even at room temperature) through Van
        derWaalsforce&#x0005B;7&#x0005D;and/orhydrogenbondingbetween surface OH-groups
        &#x0005B;12&#x0005D;. Therefore, we can integrate InGaAsP/InP materials on fully processed
        LSI wafers without degradation of the LSIs. Additionally, optical devices can be fabricated
        using photolithography after waferbondingbecausethebondscanbestrongenoughto endure following
        device fabrication t__ process. This will facilitate alignment of large number of small
        optical devices with Si circuits, resulting in a potentially inexpensive .nertd ytm In this
        paper, we report on wafer bonding of InP to Si and fabrication of InGaAsP/InP lasers on Si
        substrates. Room temperature CW operation of edge-emitting lasers and photo-pumped operation
        of surface emitting lasers are discussed. In addition, a novel bonding process, which allows
        integration of optical devices on structured wafers, is also reported.</p>
      <p>Wafer bonding process Bonding process starts with chemical cleaning of wafer surfaces with
        HySO4 :H2 O,:HyO solution, followed by rinse in de-ionized (DI) water. After this cleaning.
        the surfaces show hydrophilic. which has been reported to be preferable for achieving strong
        bonds at relatively low temperatures &#x0005B;13-14&#x0005D;. The wafers are then spin dried
        and their surfaces are placed in contact at room temperature under some pressure applied on
        the wafers to ensure the surface contact. The wafers adhered to each other at this stage,
        though the adhesion is not very strong. Finally, the wafers are annealed at 400 'C for 30
        min in an H- atmosphere to increase the bonding strength. Bonding mechanism has been
        extensively discussed for Si-to-Si wafer bonding &#x0005B;12&#x0005D;&#x0005B;151, and the
        similar mechanism is thought to be responsible also in the case of InP-to-Si. The proposed
        mechanism is schematically summarized in Fig. 2. First of all, OH-groups are absorbed on the
        wafer surface during the cleaning process with H-SO 4 :HO,:HO (Fig. 2 (a)), which is thought
        to be an origin of the hydrophilicity. When the cleaned surfaces are brought into contact at
        room temperature, the wafers adhere by hydrogen bonding between the OH-groups (Fig. 2 (b)).
        In the following heat treatment at moderate temperatures (200 'C &lt; T &lt; 400 OC), water
        molecules start to escape from the interface and the hydrogen bonds are replaced by bonds
        like InP-O-Si (Fig. 2 (c)). This bond is usually stronger than hydrogen bond, which causes
        increased strength at higher temperatures. When the wafers are annealed at even higher
        temperatures (T &gt; 500 'C), evaporation of phosphorus from InP and migration of indium
        atoms become pronounced and this can cause atomic rearrangement at the interface and result
        in stronger bonds (Fig. 2 (d)). A unique feature in the case of InP-to-Si bonding is that
        thermal expansion coefficients are different between the materials and it causes thermal
        stress which may produce cracks or even separate the wafers during annealing under
        someconditions&#x0005B;9&#x0005D;&#x0005B;16&#x0005D;.Therefore,theactualbonding mechanism
        should be more complicated than that described above. In addition, the bonding properties
        should also depend on other characteristics such as surface morphology, wt under.s nd
        thcnsmmoeifficut.Fther understanding of the mechanism more difficult. Further investigation
        is required to describe the mechanism more clearly. Fig.2: Proposedbondingmechanism As is
        suggested from the model described above, the bonding temperature strongly affects bonding
        properties, so is very important parameter. The temperature has been optimized in terms
        of(i) quality of the bonded InP crystals. (ii) bonding strength, and (iii) compatibility
        with device processes. The higher temperature limit is imposed by the degradation of InP
        crystal quality and Si LSI circuits. The quality of the bonded materials has been evaluated
        by measuring photoluminescence (PL) intensity and found to be degraded when the bonding
        temperature was higher than 600 'C &#x0005B;17&#x0005D;, which can be attributed to the
        thermal stress induced by different thermal expansion between InP and Si. Therefore, the
        temperature has to be lower than 550 'C. Moreover, bonding below 500 'C is desirable to
        avoid the degradation . . of previously completed Si LSIs. On the other hand, the lower
        temperature limit is imposed by laser fabrication process following the wafer bonding. The
        formation of ohmic contacts on InGaAs(P)/ InP device requires to anneal the wafers at about
        400 'C in the laser fabrication, as will be described in the next section. Additionally,
        higher bonding temperature is preferable in terms of bonding strength because bonds usually
        strengthen at higher temperatures &#x0005B;9&#x0005D; and the stronger bonds will facilitate
        the following device fabrication. On consideration of these factors, the bonding temperature
        has been determined to be 400 'C in this work.</p>
      <p>InP edge-emitting lasers on Si In order to demonstrate the possibility ofwafer bonding. we
        have first fabricated InGaAsP/InP edge-emitting lasers on Si. Figure 3 shows the laser
        fabrication process. First of all, a double-heterostructure (DH) was grown by metalorganic
        vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE) on a 350- pm-thick p-type (100) InP substrate. It was composed
        of a 0.2-pm InGaAs etch-stop layer, a 1.5-pm p-InP cladding layer, a 0.15-pm InGaAsP bulk
        active layer (Xgap = 1.3 pm). a 1.5-Fm n-InP cladding layer, and a 0 .1-pm n-InGaAs cap
        layer. The epitaxial wafer, with a typical size of 10 x 10 mm .was then stuck on a glass
        plate with black wax for mechanical support (Fig. 3 (a)). Next. the p-InP substrate and
        InGaAs etch-stop layer were selectively etched to leave a thin DH film on a glass plate. The
        exposed surface of the p-InP surfceothe-Incladinlayrwatheclenedith claddg layer was then
        cleaned with HS04: HO-: HO. The surface of a Si substrate was also cleaned with HIS04: HO0:
        HO. After a DI water rinse, the wafers were spin dried and their surfaces were placed in
        contact under a pressure of 4 kg/cm at room temperature (Fig. 3 (b)). The wafers adhered to
        each other at this stage, though the bonding was not very strong. Then, the bonded wafers
        were immersed in warn organic solvent to dissolve the wax completely and detach the glass
        plate from the wafers. The wafers remained still bonded after this wax dissolving. The
        sample was then annealed at 400 'C for 30 min in an H- atmosphere (Fig. 3 (c)) to increase
        the bonding strength. A weight of 30gcn 2 was applied on the wafers during the heat
        treatment. After this wafer bonding, 8-pm-wide mesa stripes were formed using standard
        photolithography and wet etching. The active layer was slightly undercut to reduce the
        active width to 6 pm. Finally, AuGeNi and AuZn were evaporated and alloyed at 400 'C to form
        n- and p-type ohmic contacts to Fig. 3: Fabrication process of InGaAsP/InP ede- rs on Si
        usiwaerbondin. AfterthinningtheSisubstratedowntoabout100pm. the lasers were cleaved into
        300-Fm-long cavities and mounted on Si heat sinks with junction-up configuration. For
        comparison, the same laser structure was fabricated on a p-InP substrate. The light-current
        (L-1) characteristics of the devices were measured at room temperature (RT) without any
        facet coatings. A typical pulsed threshold current and corresponding current density were 36
        mA and 2kAkm.whichwereidenticaltothoseof lasersonInP substrates. The slope efficiency was
        0.25 W/A. RT CW operation has been achieved with these devices as shown in Fig. 4. In this
        figure, the L-I curves of 3 lasers on Si are shown, together with those ofconventional
        lasers on InP for comparison. The kinks in the L-I curves are due to multiple
        transverse-mode operation of the lasers with 6 jim-wide active regions. The threshold
        currents are about the same (Ith = 39 mA) for both structures, and higher output powers were
        obtained with lasers on Si. This can be attributed to lower thermal conductivity of Si
        substrates, which is one of the advantages of fabricating the lasers on Si. These results
        indicate that the wafer bonding is promising technique to integrate high-quality InP lasers
        on Si wafers. Fig. 4: L-I characteristics of the lasers fabricated on Si under
        room-temperature CW operation. . s fe ii In order to implement the optical interconnections
        between LSI chips illustrated in Fig. 1. InP surface-emitting lasers (SELs) are required to
        be integrated on Si wafers. We have tried to fabricate the InP SELs on Si by wafer bonding
        and achieved room temperature photo-pumped operation. In this section, the fabrication and
        characteristics of the InP SELs are discussed. Figure 5 shows the structure of the SEL. The
        cavity was formed by wafer bonding of an InGaAs(P)/InP epitaxial wafer to 3.5-pair Al2 O3/Si
        stacked mirror previously sputtered on a Si substrate. The InGaAs(P) / InP epitaxial wafer
        was grown by MOVPE on a p-type (100) InP substrate and was composed of a 0.1-pm p-InGaAsP
        (g= 1.3 pm) etch stop layer, a 1.1-pm p-InP cladding layer. an undoped multiple quantum well
        (MQW) active layer. a 0.25-pm n-InP cladding layer, and a 40.5-pair n-InGaAsP (Xg= 1.42 pm)
        / InP quarter-wavelength stacked mirror. The MQW active layer consisted of 12 unstrained
        InGaAs wells (7 nm-thick) and II InGaAsP barriers (6 nm-thick. gap = 1.2 pm), embedded in 38
        nm-thick InGaAsP (gap = 1.2 pm) separate confinement layers on both sides. The fabrication
        process is similar to that for the edge- emitting lasers and summarized as follows. The
        InGaAs(P)/ InP epitaxial wafer was first stuck on a glass plate with black wax and the InP
        substrate and InGaAsP etch stop layer were selectively etched. The surfaces of the exposed
        p-InPandAl 2O 3 top layer in the 3.5-pair A103 / Si mirror were then cleaned with HS04 : HO2
        : HO. After rinse and spin-dry, the surfaces were placed in contact under a pressure of 4
        kg/cm 2 at room temperature to result in adhesion of the wafers through hydrogen bonding
        between surface OH-groups. Finally, the bonded wafers were immersed in warm solvent to
        dissolve the wax completely and detach the glass plate from the wafers. 5: Schematic
        structure of InP surface-emitting laer fbiaeonS. fabricated structure was optically pumped
        by a 1.49-pm semiconductor laser through the 40.5-pair InGaAsP/InP mirror, as indicated in
        Fig. 5. The pumping laser was operated under a pulsed condition with 1--ps duration at 1-kHz
        repetition. The pumping light was focused on the sample surface using a hemispherical fiber
        with a measured spot size of 15 pm in diameter. Since 1.49- pm is out ofthe stop-band ofthe
        semiconductor mirror, the active layers can be optically pumped by the 1.49-pm laser diode.
        The reflectivities of both the InGaAsP / InP and A10 / Si mirrors were measured to be higher
        than 99/ at 1.55-pm wavelength. The resonant light of the cavity. whose wavelength was about
        1.587 pm. was collected through the Si substrate and detected using a Ge photodetector with
        a lock-in amplifier. Figure 6 shows light output versus input power characteristic at room
        temperature. A distinct lasing threshold (Pth) is clearly observed at the input power of
        14.4 mW. Polarization-resolved characteristics are also shown in the figure. Above the
        lasing threshold, about 9 0c/&#x00025; of the emitted light is confirmed to be linearly
        polarized along the (110) orientation. Full width at halfmaximum (FWHM) of the emission
        spectrum was confirmed to be reduced from 4.8 nm at the pumping level of 0.85 Pth to 1.6 nm
        above Pth. The relatively broad spectrum above the lasing threshold (1.6 nm) can be
        attributed mainly to thermally induced chirping caused by instantaneous temperature rise
        during the pulse excitation. The multi-transverse mode emission may be an additional reason
        for the broad spectrum. Fig. 6: Output power vs. input power characteristics of the SEL
        under room-temperature photo- pumped operation. From this threshold pumping power, we can
        roughly estimate the corresponding threshold current density. Since 60&#x00025; of the
        pumping light was measured tobe reected by the total cavity. 40&#x00025; of the pumping
        light is thought to be absorbed in the laser structure.RHalfof that is estimated to be
        absorbed in the InGaAsP/InP mirror, and half in the active region. The pumping efficiency
        is. therefore. approximately 20&#x00025;. Assuming this pumping efficiency and beam diameter
        of 15 pm,the threshold power density can be estimated to be 1.6 kW/cm-.From this value, the
        corresponding current density can be calculated to be around 2kA/cm.This result indicates
        that the cavity of high quality can be realized by the wafer bonding. Fabrication of
        electrically pumped SELs is now in progress.</p>
      <p>Selective-area wafer bonding In the previous sections, we have shown that high-quality
        InPlansers canbhefabricated onSi substratesowever, Si LSI wafers, on which the lasers are
        required to be integrated, have many structures and steps on their surfaces. In this
        section, we propose a bonding process which allows the integration on such structured
        surfaces. Figure 7 illustrates the proposed integration process. First, Si LSI wafers with
        some vacant spaces allocated for optical devices are designed and fabricated (Fig. 7 (a)).
        InP DH thin films are also prepared as described previously (Fig. 7(b)), and the islands are
        formed in the thin films by and etching with the same pattern as the vacant spaces on the
        LSI wafers (Fig. 7(c)). The surfaces of wafers are then cleaned, and the islands are aligned
        to vacant spaces and directly bonded at room temperature described above (Fig. 7(d)).
        removing the glass plate and annealing at 400 OC (Fig. 7(e)), optical devices are fabricated
        on the DH islands the lithography and the interconnection metals are and patterned (Fig.
        7(f)). Since small optical devices can be fabricated at this step, the DHislands and
        thecvacant spaces may be much bigger, which greatly facilitates the alignment at bondigin
        the step of Fig. 7(d). As apreliminary trial, we have fabricated InP LED arrays on bare Si
        substrates using this selective-area bonding. Figure 8shows an example of the fabricated
        LEDs. InP DHislands.200pm x 3mm, are bonded on Si and arrays of active regions 20 tm in
        diameter are fabricated in the islands. The ohmic contacts and interconnection metals are
        deposited and patterned after wafer bonding. As can be seen from this example, alarge number
        of small devices can be fabricated after bonding of relatively large size of DHislands. The
        alignment tolerance at bonding are determined by the relative size of the DR islands and
        vacant spaces on LSI wafers as shown in Fig. 7 (d). and can be made large by appropriate
        design. As illustrated in Fig. 7,we still can bond the DHislands even if there are Si LSI
        patterns on the wafers and make the optical devices aligned to the Si circuits by
        photolithography. In the example of Fig. 8, LEDs are located like electrical contact pads in
        LSIs, but, needless to say, optical devices can be fabricated anywhere in the LSI patterns
        by appropriate design. A typical L-I characteristic of the fabricated LED is shown in Fig.
        9, together with aschematic cross-section of the device. The emission wavelength was 1.3pm
        and the light emitted through the Si substrates were detected. Output power more than 100jaW
        has been obtained.RHigher outputpnower will be obtained by using SELs in the future. Fig. 7:
        Schematic illustration of the process which allows to integrate optical devices on Si LSI
        wafers. Fig. 8: An example of the fabricated LED arrays on Si wafer. Fig.9:

      <p>Conclusion Wafer bonding of InP to Si has been investigated as an integration technique to
        implement optical interconnection between Si LSI chips and InGaAsP/InP optical devices have
        been successfully fabricated on Si wafers. Room temperature CW operation of edge-emitting
        lasers and photo-pumped operation of surface-emitting lasers have been achieved. A novel
        bonding process which allows integration of optical devices on structured wafers has also
        been proposed.</p>
