<p>1 Introduction A spatial light modulator (SLM) is a device capable of impressing information onto an optical wavefront. SLMs exist in many forms &#x0005B;1&#x0005D;. Light modulation may be carried out by electro-optic, acousto-optic and mechanical effects, among others. A SLM may be addressed optically, acoustically, electrically, electronically or by electron beam. The applications of such devices are manifold and include information display, coherent optical data processing, data routing and holography. The overall field of SLMs has been reviewed in the past &#x0005B;1&#x0005D;. In this article, the discussion is restricted to a primarily descriptive treatment of SLMs in which the optical characteristics of a thin overlying layer of ferroelectric liquid crystal (FLC) are controlled in a binary fashion on a pixel by pixel basis by means of an underlying CMOS silicon backplane &#x0005B;2,3&#x0005D;. Here, we shall refer to the hybrid technology as FLC/CMOS. FLC/CMOS devices typically exhibit the following characteristics * reflective mode operation * binary modulation of light * amplitude or phase modulation possible * ease of electronic addressing (CMOS/TTL compatible) * high line count (64 to 1280 lines) * small pixel pitch (5 to 40 micron) * fast frame rate (I to 20 kHz) * high optical quality * acceptable light throughput</p>
<p>2 Principle of Construction and Operation The principle of construction and operation of a pixel of a FLC/CMOS SLM is illustrated in Figure 1. Principle of Construction The substrate is a CMOS silicon chip containing an array of 1-bit digital memory cells &#x0005B;4&#x0005D;. The data bit stored at each pixel is present as a voltage (V / +VDD) on a discrete conducting metal pad on top of the silicon. A cover glass is used to define a thin layer (typically -1 to 3jtm) of FLC; an exact thickness is obtained by means of a spacer layer (not shown) which is often placed outside of the pixel array. The bottom face of the glass is covered by a continuous layer of a transparent conductor such as Indium Tin Oxide (ITO). Thin alignment layers on both inner surfaces are used to determine the alignment configuration of the FLC within the cell. Typically, the light for all pixels passes in through a single polarizer and out through a single analyzer. Figure 1 Schematic representation of the construction and operation of a single pixel Principle of Operation The FLC layer acts as a pixellated birefringent wave plate whose crystallographic orientation is programmed on a pixel basis by a suitable (polarity and amplitude) of voltage. The voltage is applied across the FLC layer as follows VFL VITO- Vpr Although VITO is common to all pixels, V, (OV +VD.) can be programmed individually for each pixel. If V, is fixed at VITO = VDD/2, the possible values of VFLc are &#x000B1;VDD/2. Alternatively, occasional toggling of VITO between OV and +VDD allows the FLC to be driven by the full voltage of &#x000B1;VD, giving faster FLC switching at the expense of a more complicated addressing scheme &#x0005B;3,4&#x0005D;. In either case a binary pattern is set up in the FLC as suggested in Figure 2 (amplitude as illustrated or phase). Figure 2. Schematic of portion of SLM pixel array</p>
<p>3 Liquid Crystal Materials and Configurations Introduction An often stated advantage of liquid crystals is that they allow a range of optical modulations depending on the precise material and configuration. From the perspective of the SLM designer this is generally true; from the perspective of the applications engineer it is true and relevant only if the precise modulation most suited to the application is available. Here we shall describe how binary amplitude and binary phase modulation are achieved using FLC. LC Most LC materials are characterized at the molecular level by anisotropic molecular shape leading at the bulk level to anisotropy in macroscopic properties such as refractive index; the average orientation of the long molecular axis (called the director) corresponds to the extraordinary axis of the liquid crystal &#x0005B;5&#x0005D;. The smectic LC mesophase is characterized by positional ordering of the molecules over a short range and orientational ordering overalongerrange.Inparticular,themolecules reside in thin layers with the director at a fixed, usually small, angle to the layer normal as shown in Figure 3. Figure 3 Schematic representation of smectic mesophase In smectic C materials, the molecules typically contain a dipole. Alignment of the molecules gives alignment of the dipoles which leads, in the bulk, to ferroelectric properties. layern-1 layern layern+l Figure 4. In Sm C* FLCs the director orientation exhibits an offset between adjacent layers In chiral smectic C (or Sm C*), the director orientation varies in a controlled fashion from layer to layer. Constrained to lie on the surface of a cone, on progression through the layers the director (bold line) precesses around the cone as shown in figure 4.</p>
<p>Surface stabilized FLC For binary operation, the most common configuration of FLC is based upon surface stabilization of the FLC (or SSFLC) &#x0005B;6&#x0005D;. This effect is explained in detail elsewhere and briefly here. Constrained in a thin layer (no more than a few microns) between two flat substrates, the director within each smectic layer is constrained to lie parallel to the substrates; this gives two options for the director orientation, demonstrated as E and W in layers n- I and n+1 respectively in Figure 5. layer n-i layer n layer n+1 Figure 5 Two possible states of the director in SSFLC; arrows represents the dipole orientation in each state</p>
<p>Amplitude Modulation Consider a transmission mode FLC cell placed between crossed polarizers. With the FLC director parallel to the input polarizer then the light transmitted through the cell remains linearly polarized and is blocked by the output polarizer - see Figure 6. If the state of the FLC is then switched by means of an applied voltage, the FLC director rotates through an angle 20, where 0 is the angle between the director and the normal to the layer planes of figure 5. The polarization vector of light transmitted through the cell is rotated by twice the angle through which the director has shifted, i.e., 44. In this configuration the output, I, is given by I = 1, sin2(40) sin2 (Andx 1X) where 10 isthe maximumpossibleoutput An is the birefringence d is the cell thickness X is the wavelength In transmission, it can readily be shown that, for maximum optical efficiency =22.5 degrees and d =(2m+1)X / 2An where m = 0,1,2,.. Devices of other cone angle or thickness can produce useful modulation but will exhibit lower light throughput in the ON state. In practice, FLC materials are readily available with cone angles of around 22.5 degrees; a typical value of An is 0.15, giving a cell thickness of around 1.5pim in the visible wavelength region. In reflection mode, d= (2m+1))/ 4An. where m = 0,1,2,.. FLC thickness of around 0.75tm. In practice SLMs of this nominal FLC thickness can be difficult to produce with acceptable within and between devices. The alternative is to aim for a FLC thickness of d = 3X/ 4An. or just over 2gm, trading off likely better uniformity for slower FLC switching. Figure 6. Binary amplitude modulation by FLC. Top - dark state. Bottom - Light state Figure 7. Binary phase modulation by FLC. Bottom - polarization rotated clockwise by FLC. Top - polarization rotated anti- clockwise by FLC.</p>
<p>Phase Modulation A number of schemes have been proposed, and indeed demonstrated, for binary phase modulation. For maximum optical efficiency and t phase difference the thickness constraint is as before, however in this case = 45 degrees and the input polarization should be set to bisect the angle between the two possible director orientations as shown in Figure 7. Once again, devices of other cone angle or thickness can produce useful modulation but will exhibit greater light loss. FLC materials with ~ 45 degrees are not widely available.</p>
<p>Practical Issues There are some practical issues concerning the use of FLC layers in CMOS backplane SLMs which are worthy of mention. Contrast Ratio. In transmission mode cells, contrast ratios (CR) of &gt; 10&#x02019;:1 have been achieved. The contrast ratio of FLC/CMOS SLMs is limited primarily by light leaking through pixels in the OFF state to values in the range 10:1 to 100:1. This is a function of the relatively poor alignment of FLC on the backplane (usually sputtered or evaporated aluminium or aluminium alloy with a relatively rough surface) which leads to the presence of multiple FLC domains within a pixel. Bistability. While the SSFLC configuration is often described as bistable, in practice good bistability is often difficult to achieve in a silicon backplane SLM. A consequence of this fact is that the optical output of a pixel is voltage dependent. In other words, a stable drive voltage is required to produce a stable optical output. DC Balance Requirement. It is widely recognized that, in order to avoid chemical, and consequently optical performance, degradation of a LC layer, the net drive voltage across the layer must be zero over a given time period. Generically JVdt = 0 over a time period of, say, around a second. Where a bipolar voltage is driving a FLC layer this is often made more specific - &#x0201C;for every positive voltage pulse driving the LC, a negative pulse of equal duration must also drive the LC&#x0201D;. This has significant consequences for FLC/CMOS SLMs &#x0005B;3,4&#x0005D;. Switching Speed. FLC switching speeds up with increasing drive voltage, increasing temperature and shrinking cell thickness. For cell thickness of 1 to 2 pm and typical CMOS drive voltages of 3 to 10 V, switching times typically range from around 10 to 200 ps. Cone Angle. FLC cone angle is temperature dependent, rising from zero degrees as the temperature falls from the critical temperature. Wavelength Dispersion. The birefringence of FLC materials is wavelength dependent. This means, for example, that in polychromatic applications (e.g., displays) FLC layer performance can be optimised for only one wavelength. Summary. Some of the above properties are poorly characterized even for commercially available materials. Optimal device performance may require the detailed characterization of material parameters and dependencies as well as careful tolerancing of the critical device dimensions and operating conditions. In particular the custom design of materials and mixtures for use in silicon backplane driven devices is under way &#x0005B;7&#x0005D;.</p>
<p>Other LC materials and configurations While this article deals with binary FLC/CMOS SLMs, other LC materials and configurations exist which are capable of fast switching and analog modulation of the amplitude or phase of light. These include the distorted helix effect (DHF) &#x0005B;8&#x0005D;, the soft mode electroclinic &#x0005B;9&#x0005D; and antiferroelectric LC &#x0005B;10&#x0005D;. SLMs using some of these materials have been constructed &#x0005B;11,12&#x0005D;.</p>
<p>4 Pixel Design Most of the FLC/CMOS SLMs designed to date are based upon one of two fundamental pixel designs. The two root pixel designs &#x0005B;3&#x0005D; are in turn based upon (I) dynamic memory - the single transistor dynamic random access memory (DRAM) cell &#x0005B;13&#x0005D;, and (ii) static memory - the six transistor (6T) static random access memory (SRAM) cell &#x0005B;13&#x0005D;. Dynamic Memory Pixel In terms of the electronic circuit, the single transistor dynamic memory pixel is analogous to two other widely used cells - the pixel circuit for an active matrix LCD &#x0005B;14&#x0005D; and the DRAM cell for conventional electronic memory. (In the former case the active switching element is usually a thin film amorphous silicon or polysilicon transistor rather than, as in the latter, a MOSFET.) We shall henceforth refer to this pixel design as &#x0201C;DRAM&#x0201D;. The pixel circuit is sketched in Figure 8. The elements of the circuit are * column bus line containing the voltage to be driven into the pixel * row bus line controlling the state (ON/OFF) of the MOSFET * MOSFET switch determines when the pixel is isolated from / connected to the column bus * capacitance, Csub, stores the pixel voltage and presents it to the FLC via the mirror / pad * ITO counter electrode (common to all pixels) Figure 8. Single transistor pixel circuit Advantages of DRAM pixel. The DRAM pixel design has a number of key advantages. These are * Small area. As with electronic memory the IT DRAM design has the smallest possible area and, for a given fabrication process, allows the maximum pixel packing density * Low complexity. This is a very simple circuit. Of course, in order to maximise the performance of the circuit, the complexity of the fabrication process may have to be increased. * Unipolar circuit. The cell contains no complimentary structures (i.e., nMOS and pMOS devices in close proximity). Disadvantages of DRAM pixel. The disadvantages inherent in the DRAM pixel design are now listed. * Loss of drive voltage. Assuming a supply rail voltage of VDD on the silicon backplane, and assuming that in order to drive the pixel mirror high VD is applied to both row and column bus lines, the maximum voltage reaching the pixel mirror is Vpix-max VDD -V&#x02019;T where V&#x02019;, is the threshold voltage of the pixel MOSFET enhanced by the body effect. (The body effect boosts the threshold voltage from the zero bias case, V,,, to a higher value when a positive potential is present between source and bulk &#x0005B;15&#x0005D;.) For typical values of VD = 5V, VT, =IV, then V&#x02019;T - 1.5 to 2V and Vpimax - 3 to 3.5V, i.e., Vpi.max - 0.7 VDD A loss of drive voltage represents a reduction in switching speed, a loss of stored charge on Cub, a potential asymmetry in the efforts to dc balance the FLC and a variation in Vxmax because VTo exhibits a natural process variation. The full magnitude of the column voltage, VDD, can be achieved at the mirror only by applying a suitably larger voltage (&gt;&gt;VDD) to the MOSFET gate via the row line. * Drive limitations. The charge required to fully switch the state of the SSFLC is Q = 2PsA where Ps is the spontaneous polarization of the FLC and A is the pixel area The charge stored on the pixel mirror is Q = CsubVpix,mx For efficient fast switching of the FLC, clearly we require Csub &gt;&gt; 2PsA / Vixmax Insufficient charge storage (either too small a value of Csb or too high a value of Ps) leads to slow or even incomplete switching of the FLC. * Charge leakage. Cub consists of several components, one being the capacitance of the reverse biased source to bulk pn junction &#x0005B;15&#x0005D;. This junction exhibits charge leakage causing any voltage stored on the pixel mirror to decay towards the substrate potential (OV for nMOS pixel FET, VDD for pMOS). The rate of voltage discharge is increased when photons impinge on the silicon substrate and has been shown to allow a relaxation in the state of the FLC (i.e., a ripple in the orientation of the director) which, in turn, causes a loss of throughput and loss of contrast in SLMs performing amplitude modulation or a phase ripple in SLMs performing phase modulation. Voltage discharge implies a requirement to continually refresh the data in the pixel array before it becomes corrupted. Finally, it represents a real source of asymmetry in the efforts to dc balance the FLC. Design Aims. The aims in designing the pixel circuit are * maximise storage capacitance * maximise flat fill factor * minimise electrical crosstalk between storage and adjacent nodes * minimise charge leakage DRAM Pixel Summary. The overriding benefit of the DRAM style pixel is that it maximises pixel packing density. Even in an ASIC process, pixel pitch of down to around ten times the process geometry (i.e., 10tm pixel in a lym CMOS process) is generally easily possible. To that end much effort has been devoted, over the years, to the design and fabrication of DRAM SLM pixels which minimise the disadvantages listed &#x0005B;16,17&#x0005D;. The potential exists to increase pixel packing density further by the use of a DRAM specific process for SLM backplane fabrication. Note. The DRAM style pixel is inherently an analog storage circuit (albeit neither robust nor linear) and is thus eminently suitable for use with analog LC materials. Much of the complexity of such analog SLMs lies in the drive circuits peripheral to the pixel array &#x0005B;11&#x0005D; and in the addressing schemes required in order to overcome the disadvantages described above.</p>
<p>StaticMemoryPixel In applications where one of the following takes precedenceover switchminseed pixel packing * * output stability (phase or amplitude) * high optical input power static memory represents a preferred alternative to DRAM. A standard 6 transistor static RAM (6T SRAM) cell &#x0005B;131 is shown in Figure 9. A SLM based upon this pixel circuit would require one of the complimentary nodes of the SRAM to connect to the pixel mirror. Figure 9. Six transistor static RAM circuit In general, performance and stability is improved by inserting a buffer between the SRAM and the mirror as shown in Figure 10. Typical buffers include the 2 transistor MOS inverter &#x0005B;181 and the 4 transistor MOS XNOR or XOR gate &#x0005B;19,20&#x0005D; (the latter pair being functionally equivalent in this context). Figure 10. Static RAM based pixel circuit The advantages and disadvantages of the SRAM style pixel circuit are complimentary to those of the IT DRAM pixel circuit.</p>
<p>Advantages of SRAM style pixel * V,, drive voltage. The full power rail voltage of the backplane is available to drive the FLC * Unlimited charge capacity. In this case the mirror is always shorted to one or other of the power rails via a MOSFET in the ON state thus allowing as much charge as required to flow on or off the mirror. * Stable drive sienal. The pixel mirror voltage is not subject to reduction as the FLC switches. Thus high P, high speed FLC materials can be used. Nor is the 82 Spatial</p>
<p>Disadvantages of SRAM style pixel * Large area. The SRAM style pixel takes up a larger area (with a pitch of typically twenty to thirty times the process geometry). * Latchup danger. The complimentary nature of the circuit leaves the pixel vulnerable to latchup (a permanent and destructive failure mechanism) which can be induced by the presence of light in the substrate &#x0005B;21&#x0005D;. * Switching transients. In large arrays the transient current produced by switching the state of a large number of SRAM cells simultaneously can cause temporary or permanent damage to the backplane. Design Aims. The aims in designing the pixel circuit are * maximise flat fill factor * minimise switching current * ensure sufficient latchup protection SRAM Pixel Summary. The overriding benefit of the SRAM pixel circuit is its ability to apply a greater voltage and charge to the FLC. This is achieved at the expense of silicon real estate.</p>
<p>4 CMOS Silicon Floor plan Figure 11. Schematic of typical SLM floorplan Figure 11 shows a typical floorplan for a device. Electronic data flows into the bonding pads to be routed by the row and column address circuitry into the pixel array. Die sizes range up to around 20mm. The pixel array is typically 4 to 5mm less wide than the die. The area between the pixel array and the bonding pads is used for a glue seal to which the cover glass is attached.</p>
<p>Addressing the array Data is normally written into the pixel array row-at-a time. The address circuit determines whether the array is addressed row sequentially or in any chosen order. Data for a row is assembled at the column drivers and transmitted to the column address lines. A pulse is then sent to the gate lines of a row of pixels which switches on the MOSFETs for that row, thus allowing the data to flow onto the mirrors as shown for the middle row of DRAM pixels in Figure 12. Figure 12. Data is written to a row of pixels by a pulse on the gate line. In the row being addressed here, black represents a logic zero and white represents a logic 1.</p>
<p>Consequences of DC balance  The requirement to DC balance the FLC at the pixel level is generally achieved at the SLM level as follows. Once a frame of data is written onto the array and optically interrogated to produce a bit plane image, it is immediately followed by a complimentary frame, i.e., one which produces the inverse of the image. The main consequence of this form of addressing is that the useful frame rate of the SLM is reduced, normally halved. A second consequence is that, in order to &#x0201C;see&#x0201D; only the actual image, the complimentary image is usually not interrogated. In other words, the read beam must be pulsed an synchronised with the SLM. A further is that even for a still image, the SLM data must be constantly updated. Suitable combinations of addressing scheme and pixel circuit design can, at least partially, alleviate all of the above &#x0005B;22,23&#x0005D;.</p>
<p>Frame rates The electronic frame address time &#x0005B;24,25&#x0005D; for a FLC/CMOS SLM addressed line sequentially is given by tfree = 2 (taddress + tFL + tinterrogate) where taddress is the time to electronically address the full frame tFLC istheLC switchingor settlingtime tinterrogate is the time during which the the SLM is illuminated The factor 2 above arises due to the DC balancing requirement. tinterrogate is application specific, depending on the light output requirements. tFJJ is device specific; it depends upon FLC material, drive voltage, temperature etc. taddressisgivenby taddress = where N is the number of rows M is the number of columns f is the bus clock frequency w is the bus width i.e., NM is the number of pixels and fw is the bandwidth of the address bus. For example, a device containing 102468pixels driven at60Mhz via a 64 bit wide bus has taddress =20ts and aburst data rate of almost 4 Gbit/s.</p>
<p>Power dissipation The issues of backplane design for FLC/CMOS SLMs are primarily two fold - small scale pixel level circuit and layout design as discussed above and large scale chip/ system level high speed digital design concerned with clock distribution and skew, current pulse handling and power routing and dissipation. Power dissipation from electrical switching and, in high intensity applications, from absorbed light can, in large fast devices, be significant. In the EU 512x512 pixel device (mentioned in table 1) operated at 50Mhz, electrical power dissipation on chip is around 100mW. McKnight and co-workers discuss the dependency of electrical power on the nature of the data being displayed &#x0005B;26&#x0005D;.</p>
<p>5FLC/CMOSdevices Post Processing The surface finish of standard silicon wafers is not sufficientforSLMsinseveralways Spoorflatness.- underlyingtopologyaffectsthe surface profile of surfce the mirror. rofle o th miror&#x0005B;31&#x0005D; usually left (see * poor smoothness - too granular, affecting reflectivity and FLC alignment quality * low flat fill factor - that fraction of the pixel area covered by a flat mirror electrode One solution to these shortcomings has been the development of SLM specific wafer post-processing techniques for &#x0201C;planarization&#x0201D; of the silicon backplanes. Two main lines have been followed with significant success * chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP) &#x0005B;27,28,29&#x0005D; * spin-on coating (SOC) &#x0005B;30&#x0005D; In both cases the process flow is outlined as follows 1. apply planarized dielectric layer - either spin-on polymer or low temperature PECVD oxide followed by CMP 2. etch via holes 3. deposit and pattern additional metal layer to give larger 4. (i.e., higher fill factor) flatter mirrors Figure 13 shows electron micrographs of a backplane before and after an early planarization. Recent &#x0005B;31&#x0005D; developments have reduced the gap between mirrors and the via size, leading to a further increase in flat fill factor. Figure 13.

<p>Cell Fabrication and Filling Some of the current bottlenecks in device performance arise from lack of uniformity in * FLC alignment * FLC layer thickness * global (i.e., chip scale) backplane flatness Clearly, the final two are linked. The last is more of a problem for non-imaging (e.g., crossbar) systems than for imaging systems. The contrast ratio and uniformity levels achieved in silicon backplane devices generally fall well short of those achieved in glass on glass test cells. Clearly the silicon backplane is not as &#x0201C;alignment friendly&#x0201D; as a glass substrate so particular attention has to be paid to the alignment layer. A number of techniques have been discussed and implemented for achieving LC alignment in general &#x0005B;33&#x0005D;. These include rubbed and treated polymers, evaporated ITO, Langmuir-Blodgett films and UV cured polymers. Some recent work suggests that the cell filling process plays a part in determining the alignment in a silicon backplane device &#x0005B;34&#x0005D;. This is an area in which there is much physics still poorly understood and where there is significant potential for performance improvement. FLC cell thickness is typically set by the use of calibrated spacer balls or rods spread across the chip surface by blowing, or spun-on in a (subsequently evaporated) liquid. Some devices simply use high points in the topography available on the backplane to provide a cell gap &#x0005B;18&#x0005D; but this is haphazard as well as being incompatible with planarization. Recent work has demonstrated the feasibility of adding pillars of oxide to the backplane as an addendum to the planarization process in order to form inert spacers of precise and uniform height &#x0005B;31&#x0005D;. When diced from the wafer and examined interferometrically, backplanes typically exhibit several fringes indicating a significant bow or lack of flatness. Bowing at the global or chip scale on a device used in reflection mode gives rise to aberrations in the optical system. The bowing varies from chip to chip and so could only be compensated on an individual basis. Meanwhile, achieving absolute (i.e., optical) flatness of the backplane in a finished device is problematic. Several potential solutions currently being investigated include the fixing the backplane to an optically flat substrate, fixing the backplane to a thick optically flat cover glass and depositing stress relieving layers on to the back of the wafer prior to dicing.</p>
<p>6 The State of the Art Some idea of the state of the art in backplane technology can be gained from Table 1. In summary, pixel counts of 2562 to around 10002 are now (or, in some cases, soon will be) available. Pixel pitches of less-than-ten to a-few-tens- of microns are common. Planarized fill factors (not tabulated here) are commonly in the range 80&#x00025; to 90&#x00025;. I have not included many of the more detailed performance criteria such as frame rate and optical efficiency as these figures are measured or quoted in ways which are not always directly comparable. In FLC technology typical switching speeds of a-few-tens to around a hundred microseconds can be obtained with CMOS compatible drive voltages. Materials with cone angles of close to 22.5 degrees are available. Contrast ratios of around 10:1 to 100:1 are being achieved in SLMs. This is much poorer than is available in test cells a fact which is generally attributed to difficulties is FLC alignment over silicon backplanes. Generally speaking, materials with higher Ps and / or smaller cone angle exhibit faster switching and cells with stronger bistability exhibit slower switching. Table 1.

<p>7 Applications Historically, the main applications for FLC/CMOS SLMs have been &#x0201C; crossbar switching &#x0005B;40&#x0005D; &#x0201C; telecomms switching &#x0005B;41&#x0005D; * optical correlator (input and/or Fourier plane) &#x0005B;42,43&#x0005D; * dynamic holography &#x0005B;44,45&#x0005D; More recently, the increase in capability of the technology has led to its use as acomponent inminiature display systems &#x0005B;36,39,46,47,48&#x0005D; for use in head mounting, projection and other applications. Asimple schematic of the heart of such asystem is shown in Figure 14. The illumination subsystem typically consists of awhite light source and fast-switching colour filter or red, green and blue LEDs. Afull color single frame is made upof a number of sequentially displayed bitplanes, each For up todate availability, contact the design house except EU 2562 - contact CR1.Smectic Technology, Hayes, UK. 2Completed to hebest of the author&#x02019;s knowledge,1IJune 1997. &#x02018;SLIMDIS - GEC Marconi Research Centre, Admit Design Systems, Davin Optical Holdings, Swindon Silicon Systems, The University of Edinburgh. illuminated by the appropriate color light. For by binary weighting successive bit-planes illuminated one color, n bit-planes can display 2n colors. Figure 14. Basic schematic of miniature display system The primary advantages of silicon backplane displays over other display technologies are * small physical size (of course, image size can be made much larger using magnifying optics) * ease of including additional on chip circuitry Figure 15. A bit-plane colorepicture ona 176xl76 SLM reproducedin greyscale. Some oftheaddressingcircuitryattheedgeofthe pixel array is apparent The primary advantage of this bit-plane display technology over other, e.g., analog nematic LC over silicon and active matrix LCD technologies is that with, this technology, each pixel exhibits the full range of color. (Other technologies require a triad consisting of a one red-, one green- and one blue-filtered pixel to produce a full range of color). The bit-plane approach produces a significant improvement (not apparent in Figure 15) in image appearance at high magnification.</p>
<p>Future Prospects The prospects remain good for the continued development of FLC/MOS SLMs. The emergence of display applications has injected a previously lacking level of urgency and funding into the area thus increasing the level and pace of competition. Specific directions in which the technology is likely to move in the near future include the development and use geometry silicon processes and specialised technologies such as BICMOS to speed up frame rates * custom silicon processing and/or post-processing to optimise the optical and electrical performance of the pixel * LC materials and mixtures designed and / or optimised for use in silicon backplane devices * customised mechanical, optical, illumination and electronic interface components * application specific SLM designs for, e.g., displays, correlators etc. * accepted standards for bit-plane displays * mass production processes and facilities to facilitate large volume low cost manufacture It is likely that the miniature displays market will bring down the cost and drive up the availability of SLMs to the point that other systems, previously classed as not economically viable, will become feasible.</p>
